# I have created a basic index.html file and converted it into a Zip file for deployment on AWS Amplify. Then, I navigated the AWS console to use the Amplify service and build the web application from scratch. Here are the steps I followed:

Created a new index.html page from scratch using a text VScode.
Deployed and hosted the web page using AWS Amplify.
Learned how to perform math calculations in our web application.
Created a Python Lambda function to implement the math functionality.
Tested the Lambda function to ensure it works correctly.
Invoked the Lambda function to perform the math calculations.
Created a REST API for the Lambda function using API Gateway.
Implemented persistence of the math results by creating a new DynamoDB table.
Configured permissions to allow the Lambda function to write to the DynamoDB table.
Updated the Lambda function code to include writing to the DynamoDB table.
Modified the index.html page in Amplify to call the API Gateway endpoint.
Re-deployed the index.html page using AWS Amplify.
